***Your slides are code. Your code is art.***

**Tired of fighting with Google Slides or Keynote?** 

If you're someone who dreads the phrase "just use this template," Calliope Canvas is your solution.

We believe that if your stack uses code, your presentations should too. This app fixes the pain of building slides and transforms it into a fluid, component-driven development process. You get to write your slides in React and TypeScript, unlocking the ability to build literally any custom animation, complex interactive element, or breathtaking pizzazz you can dream up.

**Version control for your slides**

Because your slides are just simple, modular code, they integrate perfectly with Git. This means collaboration is easy, design changes are straightforward to review, and if a stakeholder asks you to revert to last month’s version, you can do it without breaking a sweat.

**No more templates**

Stop wrestling with outdated software. Start building unforgettable decks on a powerful, version-controlled codebase designed for technical elegance and visual impact.
